# Bluetooth Performance Evaluation: Classic Bluetooth vs BLE

This repository contains the complete experimental framework, datasets, scripts, and results used to evaluate and compare the performance of **Classic Bluetooth** and **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** under multiple scenarios.

The project focuses on **latency (RTT)**, **throughput**, and **transfer duration**, considering distance, file type, file size, and Wi-Fi interference.

## Project Objectives

The main goals of this project are:
- To experimentally evaluate Classic Bluetooth and BLE performance
- To study the impact of distance on latency and throughput
- To analyze file transfer behavior for different content types
- To highlight BLE protocol limitations for bulk data transfer
- To assess the impact of Wi-Fi interference on Bluetooth communication
- To provide a clear, reproducible experimental methodology

## Experimental Scenarios

### Scenario S1 – Random Data Transfer (Classic Bluetooth)
- Transmission of randomly generated byte streams
- Metrics: RTT, throughput
- Distances: 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 7 m, 10 m
- Purpose: baseline performance evaluation of Classic Bluetooth

### Scenario S2 – File Transfer (Classic Bluetooth)
- File types:
  - TXT (plain text)
  - JPG (high-resolution image)
  - MP3 (audio)
  - MP4 (video)
- Metrics: transfer duration, throughput
- Distances: 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 7 m, 10 m
- Purpose: evaluate impact of file type and size on performance

### Scenario S3 – Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- GATT-based communication
- File sizes: 50 KB and 1024 KB
- Metrics: RTT, throughput, transfer duration
- Purpose: analyze BLE suitability for data and file transfer
- Includes a study of synchronous GATT write limitations

### Scenario S4 – Wi-Fi Interference Impact
- Classic Bluetooth transfers with and without active Wi-Fi interference
- Metrics: throughput and transfer duration
- Distances: 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 7 m, 10 m
- Purpose: assess coexistence issues in the 2.4 GHz band
